# Sector Allocation Strategy under Changing Interest Rates

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how changes in interest rates affect sector-level stock performance.
The goal is to provide a consulting-style recommendation on sector allocation strategies
under different interest rate environments.

## Business Question
In different interest rate environments, which equity sectors should be overweighted
or underweighted to optimize risk-adjusted returns?

## Hypotheses
H1. Interest rate changes affect sector performance asymmetrically; not all sectors respond
to interest rate movements in the same way.

H2. During rising interest rate environments, Financials and Energy sectors outperform
the overall market.

H3. During declining interest rate environments, Technology-oriented sectors outperform
other sectors.

H4. Sectors that are more sensitive to interest rate changes exhibit higher volatility,
indicating the need for risk-adjusted allocation strategies.
